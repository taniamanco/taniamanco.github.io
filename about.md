Hey Iâ€™m Tania! I'm a 32-year-old mother of two rambunctious toddlers and a wife to Max. I have a lot on my plate right now, but I really wouldn't have it any other way. I'm following my dreams while taking care of the people that I love. Most days, I'm living my version of my best life. 

Take a look around. If my journey resonates with you, feel free to come back often. Leave a comment or kind word if you want. I'll provide regular updates on my blog and social media channels. You should especially reach out if you're also considering transitioning into web development. I can point you to several free and paid resources that can help you.
